# MissileWorks
MissileWorks is a collection of missiles that are user-controllable, fully autonomous, or anywhere in between. The GTA5 physics engine is used, with the game itself being the sandbox.


## Collection

### Hellstorm Missile
The first to be developed, and uses the simplest controls. Similar to the Hellstorm in CoD Black Ops games. It is an user-controlled cruise missile, capable to launching cluster bombs that are fully autonomous. Cluster bombs (see Guided Missile) target selected game entities.


### Guided Missile
Fully autonomous lock-on missile that guides itself to a selected target. The missile's position, velocity (and by extension, air/ground speed), orientation, and angular velocity are all used to simulate aerodynamic forces acting on the missile.
